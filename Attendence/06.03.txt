On March 6th, we had a class with Ms. Mnatsakanyan, who explained how the product should be presented and what we mean by product requirements. Additionally, Ms. Hovhannisyan demonstrated a few examples of product documentation and outlined what it should contain. This session will help us present our own product (project) at the end of the course.
