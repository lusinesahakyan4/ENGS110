Our first lesson took place on the 21st of January. We started the class by introducing ourselves and talking about our dream projects. Then we discussed some practical and technical matters such as Linux and GitHub setups. We had a small lecture about compilers and hardware after which we had a small Q&A with Ms. Hovhannisyan and Ms. Mnatsakanyan.
